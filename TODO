This project needs some love.

* Decent binary/option parsing, it's a shoddy right now.
* YAML per-user config

Terminology:

layouts
 - overall file layouts (PHP, static HTML)

variants
 - default
 - 2 column
 - banner
 - splash page
 
etcetera

Ideally i'd like to be able to create multiple variants for a single project.

Also, a cool idea would be able to create composite variants, e.g.:

"banner,3-column,footer"

but maybe overkill


Variants should be customisable using variables, somehow

options
-------
 - additional stuff that can be added to any project
 - for example:
   - sifr
   - jquery plugins
   - default CSS (content.css)
  
options should be able to include files and append code to others (i.e. jquery onload)
   
   
per user defaults
-----------------

~/site-skel/defaults.yml

layout: php

options:
  - jquery
  - content.css
  - sifr
  - input-hint

variant:
  global:
    width: 900

should also be able to have a site-skel.yml file in the root dir of a project

spinoff project: config-merger
  (i already use this pattern in lighty, might as well abstract it)
